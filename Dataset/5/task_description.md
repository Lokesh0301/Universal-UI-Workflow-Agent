In this task, the agent demonstrates a complete end-to-end workflow for creating and labeling a new issue inside Linear. The agent begins by opening the New issue modal from the Issues workspace. After the modal appears (a non-URL UI state), the agent enters the issue title “testttt.” It then opens the Labels dropdown, types “bug” to filter available labels, and selects the Bug label from the results. Finally, the agent submits the issue by clicking Create issue, and a final UI capture confirms that the new issue has been successfully created with the correct title and label.
