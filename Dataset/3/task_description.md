In this task, the agent navigates the Linear Issues workspace and demonstrates how to modify metadata within the issue creation modal. The agent begins on the main Issues page and opens the New issue modal (a non-URL UI state). Once the modal appears, the agent interacts with the Priority dropdown, expanding the menu to reveal all priority levels. The agent then selects High priority, successfully updating the issue’s metadata. A final UI capture confirms that the priority field has been updated and visually reflected inside the modal.
