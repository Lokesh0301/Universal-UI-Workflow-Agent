In this task, the agent navigates the Notion workspace and performs the workflow to create a new page with a custom title. The agent starts on the main Notion dashboard and selects “New page” from the sidebar, opening a blank page (a non-URL UI state). Once the editor loads, the agent focuses the title input region and enters the page title “Lokesh Madem.” A final screenshot confirms that the title has been correctly set at the top of the page.
